00:00:00,120 --> 00:01:42,119
this speaker outperformed Tony Robbins last year he was more popular and people love Tony Robbins it's no put in not sailing against Tony he's amazing I love the guy but people said he was better so let me ask you a question imagine you're living in your dream home you got the cabin for the family the beach house your bills are paid you've built something big but you don't have your health I remember Curtis crawling through his house for months literally sliding on a piece of cardboard his wife would drag him through the house because he couldn't walk how important is our health well our final speaker today is about to rock your world about elite health not just yeah I'm healthy I mean Elite levels of health help me welcome the stage one of my favorite well no no no no no no no

2
00:00:50,039 --> 00:02:38,159
roll the video here we go you're one of my best friends you've been such a good friend of me blah blah there's nothing I could ever do for you so I'm going to do this I'm going to introduce you to this guy named Gary brecka [Music] I know Gary brecka our friend yeah Gary I love Gary by the way I love Gary yeah my name is Gary breckov I'm a human biologist researcher and a biohacker for 20 years I spent my lifetime working in the insurance industry predicting mortality to the month which meant if I got five years of medical records and five years of demographic data the team that I was associated with could actually tell an insurance company how long you had to live to the month after years and years of this type of research and Analysis I realized one thing there were human beings on the other

3
00:01:49,860 --> 00:03:36,621
side of the spreadsheets that I was working on and that I didn't want to spend another day of my lifetime predicting how long people were going to live and I wanted to help them live happier healthier more fulfilling lives you see we were put on the surf to thrive God gave us everything that we need in order to manifest our destiny and Thrive clean clear cognitive energy the waking energy of a tiger this guy's incredible he's amazing yeah and this guy can come in and literally change her life and if we want Optimal Health we have to educate ourselves and go out and find ways to go inside of our bodies find the missing raw material that's keeping us from being the absolute best replace that raw material and then thrive and today I am so blessed to share my journey with all of my research with all

4
00:02:42,900 --> 00:04:35,658
of you whoa whoa yeah oh my God it's so good to be back at EXP I absolutely love you guys last year I almost had a heart attack running around this audience so I'm really excited to be here hats off to the EXP crew for throwing another amazing amazing conference we got a lot to cover today guys um I broke my my talk today down into 15-minute segments I know some of you have heard me speak before some of you haven't for those of you that haven't the first 15 minutes of my talk will be very similar to what it was last year the next 15 minutes I'm going to talk about how every single person in this audience can wake up like a Spartan warrior can have a superhuman inside of them and I'm gonna bring it out of every person in this audience I'm going to teach you how to wake up like a Spartan

5
00:03:49,319 --> 00:05:27,901
warrior and how to be a superhuman no Who Wants To Be A superhuman amazing and then we're going to spend 15 minutes talking about some of the most incredible research in the world right now I just got back from the most humbling Retreat of my lifetime I was invited by Richard Branson to Necker Island with 40 of the top thought leaders from around the world he took people from every industry that he thought were the greatest thought leaders he put us all on an island for four days no phones no recording devices we just shared and collaborated on Research that is impacting humanity and some of the most profound discoveries in science that are changing the entire direction of humanity and health and wellness and I'm going to share some of those with you today because you have no

6
00:04:37,560 --> 00:06:33,000
idea how powerful our mind really is and I'm going to teach you how to access an area of your mind that you may not be tapping into every day and it's robbing you of 75 of your potential so we're going to unlock that in the third 15 minutes and in the last 15 minutes of my talk and I do this every time I take the stage I make two big bold promises every time I take a stage and the first promise is if you do what I ask you to do today I will add seven years to the lifespan and the health span of every person in this room great who wants you to do that um and the second bold promise is that I will take any ailment that you or a loved one suffers from any ailment whether it's an autoimmune disease an emotional disorder a mental disorder it's hypothyroid it's hypertension any ailment that you or a

7
00:05:36,780 --> 00:07:11,938
loved one suffers from and right here in front of this audience from this stage I will tell you exactly what nutrient is missing from that body that is causing that condition to exist and then I'm going to take 15 minutes of q a from you guys so we've got a lot to cover you guys ready to get going all right awesome so for those of you that don't know me my name is Gary brecka I'm a human biologist a researcher I spent 22 years of my life in mortality research for large life insurance companies and you see large life insurance companies have a database it's got 370 million lives in it at that database that they hold could see the light of day it would permanently change the face of humanity it would upend modern medicine in a way that would be catastrophic you see

8
00:06:24,419 --> 00:07:58,020
there's 370 million lives in this database and what this database has that no other clinical study has no research study has no University no governmental agency no other place on Earth knows the day the date the time the location and the cause of death for 370 Million Lives so they take that data and they pull it back into people's lives and the team that I was on if we were able to get five years of medical records on you and five years of demographic data we could tell the insurance company how long you had to live to the month and yes it's that accurate and if you want to know how accurate insurance companies are just look at what happened in the financial services crisis right 2008 2009 we had 364 Banks fail not one life insurance company failed there's no

9
00:07:10,740 --> 00:08:42,000
other Financial Enterprise on the planet that would take that much risk on one variable 25 million 50 million or 100 million dollars worth of risk and the only thing that matters is how many more months does this person have left on Earth so I worked in this research Department I read medical records six eight hours a day six days a week for 20 years and I was brainwashed by that industry because they led me to believe that this was just data that I couldn't make an impact that it didn't matter I didn't have any influence I didn't put these people in this position I couldn't get them out of this position it was not my responsibility my responsibility was to take the data and tell my boss how many more months this person had left on Earth so they could charge them for a

10
00:07:56,400 --> 00:09:44,221
life insurance policy and I realized one day that there were human beings on the other side of those spreadsheets and I made a decision that day to turn in my resignation to leave that industry and spend the balance of my lifetime helping people live healthier happier longer lives and so that's what I'm here to do today and I'm in the process of building an army because we need an army if the pandemic didn't teach you anything about the intention of our government about the intention of modern medicine about the intention of our officials then you must have been asleep at the switch so it's not up to them it's up to us right it's up to us so I want you guys to be on my Army so I'm not going to hold any information back from you because we learned two things when I was

11
00:08:50,640 --> 00:10:18,420
predicting mortality here's some of the mortality predictions um that I did but we learned two things when I was predicting mortality and I say this every single time I take the stage this is the most impactful statement you will ever hear in terms of how many more years you have left on Earth your waking energy your cognitive function the depth of your Delta wave of sleep your weight gain your water retention your hormone balance the entire trajectory of your life and that is that the presence of oxygen is the absence of disease so I'm going to talk to you about how we get more of it how we manage it better and how we keep it at a level that helps human beings Thrive and makes this entire buy home inhospitable to disease right so the presence of oxygen is the

12
00:09:34,740 --> 00:11:23,639
absence of disease the second thing that we learned was that nearly every complication that we accept as a consequence of Aging weight gain water retention brain fog ADD ADHD OCD manic depression bipolar all kinds of mental disorders the history of a genetically inherited disease is absolutely none of those things it is a missing raw material from the human body a deficiency that is leading to those diseases you know recently I was invited to speak at a very large Age Management Medicine Group conference it was a room this size full of Physicians and when I took the stage I could feel like the uh the judgey mick judgerson-ness you know like if they weren't getting CE credits not a single one of them would have been in the room I mean it was like it was an oppressive level of hatred coming at me

13
00:10:28,800 --> 00:12:08,041
and I said let me ask you guys something um how many physicians in this audience right now by show of hands how many of you are treating patients for genetically inherited diseases genetically inherited diseases like hypertension like hypothyroid like hypercholesterolemia hypertriglyceridemia even drug and alcohol addiction anxiety depression all of these diseases that run in families and before I got through five diseases every single hand in the room was up and I said while you have your hands up understand if you're treating patients for these genetically inherited diseases understand we've mapped the entire human genome we know every Gene in the human body can any of you tell me what Gene causes any of those diseases every hand in the room went down and I said the reason why you can't tell

14
00:11:18,060 --> 00:13:07,320
me what gene causes any of those diseases is because that Gene doesn't exist which means that those diseases do not exist and then I stood there for 30 seconds and even more hate came to the stage like they they hate o mamometer was all the way in the red but no one could take issue with that and if you're a physician I invite you to take issue with that too we do not pass disease from generation to generation that is a lie that we have been sold because we have an industry that is built around managing disease but if we understood that what happens is we pass on something called methylation we pass on the inability for our body to take a raw material a vitamin A mineral an amino acid a nutrient that enters our body and convert it to the usable form you see just like we pull gasoline out

15
00:12:13,560 --> 00:13:56,340
of the ground but we can't put it into our gas tank because the car doesn't understand that fuel source until I'm sorry crude oil until it's refined to gasoline there is not a single compound known to mankind not one there's no vitamin no mineral no amino acid no protein no nutrient of any kind that we put into our bodies that is used in the form that we put it in without a single exception everything we put into our bodies gets converted by our body into the usable form if you cannot make this conversion you have a deficiency it is this deficiency that leads to those diseases and that deficiency can be fixed so that's what we're going to do today you guys with me all right all right so those are my two bold promises I'll add seven years to your life and I will take any ailment that

16
00:13:04,860 --> 00:14:32,460
you or a loved one suffers from and I'll tell you what nutrient is missing from your body in fact I might even call on some of you guys that that took the gene test last year and supplemented and have had a life-changing result if you've had a terrible result please stay quiet but um or if you had a life-changing result I I want to hear from you so this the first test that I'm talking about is is a gene test and I'm going to go through this quickly because I covered it last year but so many of us that have these conditions that we chalk up to a consequence of Aging are not a consequence of Aging so many of you right now more than more than 90 percent of this audience is walking around at 60 percent of your true state of normal even if you think you feel good you have

17
00:13:47,880 --> 00:15:36,720
no idea how good normal feels God meant for us to thrive for us to have it all and when we put the right raw materials back into our bodies we start to thrive in ways we never thought possible and so thank you I love you guys where was the lady that used to give me all the Woos last year whoo somebody used to give me was every time I would say she would go whoa and then when I refused to do something she's like I'll give you a woo um so all of these things brain fog high blood pressure gut issues all of these things are consequences of these five genetic breaks there are five genes in every human being's body in this room that determine what raw materials you can convert into the usable form and what you can't and when these genes are broken this is where those conditions come from

18
00:14:42,480 --> 00:16:12,959
and these can be fixed these can be supplemented for and they can be fixed so we do not need to walk around with the kind of ailments like we do in society if you look at the trends in modern medicine you know diabetes is a 110 billion dollar annual industry do you know that 110 billion dollars a year do you think that there's a meeting going on somewhere in a big Pharma boardroom right now to put that out of business oh no you know if you said to me nobody would ever say this but if you did if you said to me Gary write me a diet that would guarantee I get diabetes you know what I would do I go right to the American diabetic association website I download their dietary guidelines and I'd send them to you that's how bad that is do it American diabetic Association you know what they

19
00:15:28,199 --> 00:17:10,358
recommend for a type 2 diabetic first thing in the morning glass of orange juice bowl of oatmeal with crushed brown sugar and natural honey as a snack yogurt with fruit on the bottom 44 grams of sugar right you know what that is that's an insulin dependency diet do you know that Pfizer just paid 6.6 billion dollars for arena Pharmaceuticals you know what arena Pharmaceuticals does anybody know fixes myocarditis pericarditis and diffuse vasculitis as a consequence of vaccine injury that's a fact so we need to understand that sometimes the powers to be don't necessarily have our best interests at heart but God has our best interests at heart and he has given us everything that we need to thrive and we're going to talk about how we tap into that today right so this is what this Gene test

20
00:16:20,339 --> 00:17:50,938
looks like it is a Q-tip we stick it in your mouth and we rub your cheek or you order it and it comes to your house and you rub your cheek and you rub the cheeks of your family members only get that test for the people you love the other ones will leave your your life early that was a joke that was a joke um so you know what right before I came up here somebody literally back backstage told me stay away from politics and stay away from the vaccine I've already covered the vaccine so I'll stay away from politics they were like don't talk about Joe Biden I'm like why would I talk about Joe Biden you know um so but I can't help thinking you know like if if a spaceship like landed in the United States you know they all seem to land in Arizona so that's where all the spaceships land actually One landed

21
00:17:06,059 --> 00:18:43,821
in Vegas recently but if a spaceship like land in the United States and they got out and said take me to your leader I just think about that once in a while on what would they think we'll just leave it at that so so there I covered politics and the vaccine and 40 of the audience still likes me come on take me to your leader so these five genes so what happens when these genes are broken I put grant card Allen down there because that's actually Grant cardone's um Gene brakes one of the reasons why I'm wearing this 10x Health shirt is because I fixed those genetic breaks in Grant Cardone and got rid of joint pain and sleeplessness and aches and pains in his body and brain fog and as he realized the consequences of that in his business he called me one day and said Gary your stuff works

22
00:18:00,120 --> 00:19:35,340
if you can be in my office at two o'clock tomorrow afternoon I'll make you a rich man and I was in his office at 159 the one meeting of my life that I was actually early for was with that man to make me a rich man he kept This Promise so these five genes everybody has those when you have these genes that are broken let me Point some of these out do you see this Gene right here 44 percent of you have this Gene not working I won't tell you what the nickname is for that Gene Brett I'm going to keep my promise where are you okay I I went to the speaker meeting this morning yes that is called the MTHFR Gene if you ever want to look up research on that Gene please capitalize all of those letters or you will find yourself on some really colorful websites so this Gene 44 of you actually have a

23
00:18:47,580 --> 00:20:20,820
break in this Gene this is one of the most important genes in the human body because it takes folic acid and converts it into methylfolate and while that doesn't sound like a big deal folic acid is the most prevalent nutrient in the human diet folic acid by the way is an entirely man-made chemical we make it in a laboratory folic acid does not occur anywhere naturally on the surface of the Earth you cannot find folic acid in nature we make it in a lab and then we have sold it to the public as a health as a health vitamin something that pregnant women need to have a healthy pregnancy that's completely false they need methylfolate to have a healthy pregnancy 85 percent of all postpartum depression is directly related to the prenatal vitamin there is not a single peer-reviewed

24
00:19:34,200 --> 00:20:59,460
published clinical study in the world linking pregnancy hormones to postpartum depression there is tons of research linking that Gene to postpartum depression so what happens is when the most prevalent nutrient in the human body cannot be converted into something the body can use you have a deficiency and now what kind of things come from that deficiency well the first thing is gut issues you have gut issues and you think you have an allergy but it drives you crazy because you cannot you eat the same thing over and over and sometimes you have a reaction and sometimes you don't because it has nothing to do with what you're eating has to do with the pace of your gut the speed of your gut is determined by that Gene if that Gene is broken you have suffered your entire life with gas

25
00:20:16,980 --> 00:21:59,220
bloating diarrhea constipation irritability cramping and you've never been able to pinpoint why because your body is missing a simple raw material called methylfolate if you have this Gene right here there is about a 90 chance that you suffer from anxiety and some of you may suffer from crippling anxiety even borderline depression you know what anxiety is anxiety is a fear of the future it is an increase in your brain in a category of neurotransmitters called catecholamines the same neurotransmitters that come out in a fight or flight scenario how many of you suffer from anxiety or know somebody who suffers from anxiety holy cow seventy percent of the room you ask somebody that suffers from anxiety these three questions I will prove to you that is coming from that

26
00:21:07,320 --> 00:22:43,421
Gene and it can be fixed with methylated vitamins and if anyone in this room has either had that problem and it's now fixed or had a loved one who had that problem last year and it's now fixed is there anyone in here that would like to tell that story because I branded just a couple people at the pool there's one right there with their hand up you come up this microphone if you start to say something bad I'm just going to burn one of your eyes out with this laser point yeah I've already cried on stage nothing nothing will learn you like losing an eye to a laser pointer um yeah so it was uh last year uh when you said this this talk and my daughter um just crippling anxiety and uh you know just very inward in everything she did and I was all in ordered it for for the

27
00:21:57,600 --> 00:23:37,920
whole family and um So within like three weeks of being on the supplements her uh she's she was Into Horses it's kind of her way of dealing and all of that and uh her horse instructor didn't even recognize her she was yelling across the barn and just a totally different person amazing she joined the cheerleading team at her school oh and like just wildly different she couldn't even get out of her seat to get on stage when her classmates were you know just going on stage to graduate before and she took five of the eight Awards wow just this past year that's amazing and she was on stage and waving at everybody and just she's on no drugs she's on no Pharmaceuticals that little girl took that test and all she's taking is vitamins that's how we're going to change the world

28
00:22:48,120 --> 00:24:14,038
that's how we're going to change the world do you have this um Gene right here you um you have a history of hypertension in your family how many of you either suffer from hypertension or have a loved one suffering from high blood pressure you see high blood pressure is the second leading cause of death in America and most of people that actually suffer from high blood pressure when they go to their doctor they have a normal EKG they have a normal EEG they have normal heart and lung sounds they have a normal dye contrast study they have a normal cardiac catheterization all their cardiac work up is normal why do they have high blood pressure their doctor will tell you because your father had it and your grandfather had it and your great-grandmother on your mother's side had it you genetically

29
00:23:30,419 --> 00:25:13,201
inherited that hypertension next time you know what to say oh What gene did I inherit that caused that watch their face go blank what happens is when you have this gene mutation you cannot lower an amino acid in your blood called homocysteine if this is a naturally occurring amino acid but genetically we break this amino acid down into another harmless amino acid which quiets our mind and if we can't quiet our mind now we're told that we have ADHD or add that's another famous one or OCD right and so if I can't actually lower that amino acid then what happens is it rises in my bloodstream as it circulates around in my bloodstream my arteries clamp down if you make the pipes smaller in a fixed system pressure goes up and now we hold the heart responsible for a crime it hasn't committed we start

30
00:24:22,320 --> 00:25:54,300
pounding on a perfectly healthy organ with beta blockers and calcium channel blockers and diuretics trying to pound a healthy organ into submission for a crime it is not committing and we do this for decades you will never convince me 44 of Americans are so depressed they need to be on an antidepressant 51 of Americans over 55 years old have a failing heart to the point where it needs medical intervention or that nearly 60 percent of Americans suffer from a mental disorder I'll never believe that what I will believe is we are so nutrient deficient that without certain nutrients we get the expression of those conditions and so if you lower homocysteine by the way if you ever watch my my video with Dana White this is exactly what happened to Dana White he was on three blood pressure

31
00:25:08,220 --> 00:26:42,659
medications when I met him 10 weeks later he was on no blood pressure medication he had perfectly normal blood pressure it was off of his antidepressants and off of his thyroid medication and so we put these raw materials back into the human body and that's how we just restore that vascular laxity to normal and then the pressure returns to normal now for you high functioning entrepreneurs if you have that Gene broken right there you have what's called consummate overachiever profile you are Your Own Worst Enemy you hold yourself to a very very high standard right you put a lot of pressure on yourself you you you essentially um decide the success or the lack thereof of your day by how many things you get done on an agenda that you set for yourself you find yourself very easily

32
00:25:55,500 --> 00:27:36,480
disappointed in other people because you feel like they just can't do the basics when you I know those laughs are like yep that's me right there I got spouses pointing at spouses so and when you lay down to go to sleep at night you have a hard time falling asleep not because you're not tired but because your mind keeps you awake right so what happens is as your environment quiets your mind wakes up so what if we could pull all these little anchors up off the ground what if when you lay down you could actually quiet the catecholamines and fall asleep what if you could actually process thought in the right sequence which is what we call attention deficit disorder there actually is no such thing as ADD or ADHD they are trust me oh I love you guys man I love you guys

33
00:26:45,659 --> 00:28:21,960
usually people are like Boo and that's not true and they need Ritalin and they need Adderall and they need Vyvanse um interestingly the same people that make folic acid Monsanto also makes vybans and Ritalin so folic acid is the leading cause of ADD ADHD and manic depression and it's treated with ritalin Vyvanse um and Adderall just a coincidence another coincidence I'll point out for you not being a conspiracy theorist so so what happens is attention deficit disorder is not an attention deficit at all it's an attention overload disorder it is too many windows open at the same time and so what happens is because we create thought at a faster rate than we dismantle thought the mind gets clouded you're thinking about a job you're working on your friend walks up so you're thinking about a job you start

34
00:27:34,320 --> 00:28:55,980
talking to your friend while you're talking to your friend you see a logo on their jacket reminds you of vacation you want to take are you thinking about a job talking to your friend looking at the logo thinking about a vacation you want to take right all at the same time your friend's like hey Max you know my grandmother died on Sunday and you go that's a great idea right that's when you know you got ADHD so what if we could just put amino acids like l-methionine back into the body lomethionine as simple as LMA thione or trimethylglycine amino acids that are already in your body and you learn to down regulate catecholamines you learn to take those those category of neurotransmitters that were in your brain and you get to suppress them you get to break down thought so that you

35
00:28:14,640 --> 00:29:39,539
can sequence thought properly and now you all of a sudden don't have ADHD because you are not having an overactive mind modern medicine says if the mind is racing let's put an amphetamine into the body race the central nervous system to match the pace of the Mind that creates dependency it creates something called tachophylaxis it can permanently alter the neuroplasticity of the brain oh methionine is in your bloodstream right now so if you have that gene mutation you take home methionine you will notice a demonstrative change in your behavior you will notice a night and day difference between children that have that MTHFR gene mutation and you take them off of folic acid and put them on a methylated vitamin and you have an entirely new child in the house in three

36
00:28:57,659 --> 00:30:26,460
to seven days happens that fast right instead of the school calling you and saying Little Johnny's not paying attention he's disruptive he doesn't finish his work we need to bring in the Ritalin right so every single person that hasn't gotten that test I want every human being to do that test once in your life it's about 600 bucks it's a gene test you put the cheek swab in your mouth you send it into a lab they send it back you will never guess what you need to supplement with for the rest of your life you will stop supplementing for the sake of supplementing and you'll start supplementing for deficiency and when you supplement for deficiency you start to thrive and so that's my pitch now moving to part two because now we're gonna have some real fun um I want to talk about something called

37
00:29:41,700 --> 00:31:32,018
the Superhuman protocol because the Superhuman protocol is basically taking everything from Mother Nature that is good from outside and bringing it in you have two choices you can pay a hundred and fifty thousand dollars which a lot of our patients do for the Superhuman equipment or you can do it for free which one do you want me to explain to you guys I knew you guys were cheap yeah um so what what is so amazing about the research that is going on now in longevity in anti-aging in biohacking and in optimization and when I was on on Necker Island with Richard and these thought leaders it really hit me that everything has now come full circle and we're just getting right back to the basics the further we get away from the basics the sicker we become human beings were originally built to

38
00:30:37,919 --> 00:32:00,900
spend 85 percent of our time outside the average human spends less than two percent of their lifetime Outdoors now so now what's happened when we've come indoors we've stopped contacting the surface of the Earth do you know that the Earth is a giant magnetic field think about the last time that you had bare feet touching bare soil dirt grass or sand that's the last time that you discharged into the Earth and this is very real by the way if you follow me on Instagram you'll see that I took a voltage meter I I plugged it into the dirt in the sand into the into the ground and I held the other pole of this voltage meter and I showed you how there was Zero voltage going through my body I was standing in tennis shoes then I took my shoes off and I stepped on the surface of the

39
00:31:20,220 --> 00:32:48,599
Earth and the pin pegged all the way to the right hand side so what happens when we touch the surface of the Earth it's called earthing it's called grounding you see we don't want it to be this easy but it is right when we touch the surface of the Earth we discharge into the Earth it actually changes the polarity of the body it can shift the alkalinity in the blood it can change the polarity of 32 trillion cells in the human body in six seconds and we don't touch the surface of the Earth anymore what we did was we came up with a pemf map pulse electromagnetic field mat that you can put in your bed and get the same thing as grounding but you can take your shoes off and contact the surface of the Earth for five minutes three times a week and maintain that same polarity the science has now

40
00:32:04,080 --> 00:33:37,140
caught up to the magnetism of the earth and the impact that actually contacting Mother Earth has on human beings the second thing that we don't get enough of is light the number one nutrient deficiency in the world is vitamin D3 the single most important nutrient in the human body fifty percent of this audience is clinically deficient in vitamin D3 85 percent of the African-American population and Latinos because of the pigment of their skin are deficient in vitamin D3 this is why covid disproportionately affected minorities had nothing to do with their minority status it has to do with the pigment of the skin the darker your skin the lower the vitamin D3 the lower the vitamin D3 the higher the all-cause mortality and the and the weaker the immune system right in fact one of the worst things

41
00:32:51,059 --> 00:34:10,800
that we did during the pandemic was further weaken our immune system by social distancing residential quarantining masking right you know what human beings Were Meant to do they're meant to do what we're doing right now right interact with other human beings right that Veil is a strong immune system what am I saying favorite sayings is that aging is the aggressive pursuit of comfort the more aggressively we pursue Comfort the faster we age the reason why most of us don't exercise or take cold showers or do cold plunges or like to diet and deal with a little Pang of hungers because we don't like to be uncomfortable the more Comfort we seek the faster we age we've got to stop telling Grandma not to go outside it's too hot not to go outside it's too cold just to lay down

42
00:33:30,840 --> 00:34:51,959
just to relax to eat at the first Pang of hunger that's all nonsense right the body has a response called hormesis where you stress it and it strengthens we're going to talk about how we can tap into that so the second thing is light we are light beings the truth is most of us are not getting enough sun it's not that we're getting too little Sun so when I wake up in the morning the very first thing I do and I don't care how cold or hot or rainy or windy it is outside I go outside and a pair of shorts my neighbors think I'm nuts I go out to hide in a pair of shorts don't I every single day I'm gonna ask my ask my wife and I go out and I take my shirt off and I get 15 to 20 minutes of sunlight and I do eight minutes of deep breath work every single day like clockwork it will change the

43
00:34:11,520 --> 00:35:40,081
trajectory of your life right and then the last thing that we talk about is oxygen so you can use a hypermax oxygen system or you can learn to do breath work and there's several styles of breath towards all kinds of breath work that's out there last year we talked about breath work there is a style of breath work called Haka breathing how many of you ever heard of that whoa oh is that because you guys follow me or have you do you actually know what that is the hakka dance have you ever seen like the All Blacks in Australia they do those crazy dances before rugby games you know why they do that it increases the oxygen content it improves physical performance it raises their emotional state it elevates their mood and it is pain modulatory rights they actually don't feel as much

44
00:34:55,260 --> 00:36:20,279
pain during contact so how would you guys like to learn a 60-second breath work technique so you could wake up like a Spartan warrior every single morning you guys want to do it right now all right because um so after this breath work technique they are definitely going to think we're a cult right so you know the spaceship's coming we're all going to heaven right um I knew there was something weird about that crew and now they're definitely going to think it so what this has to do with is you know breathwork does several things for us what it's going to do it's going to change the oxygen tension in our tissue it's going to change the ratio of gas in our tissue the second thing it's doing to do it's going to raise our emotional state it's going to elevate our mood

45
00:35:38,099 --> 00:37:24,119
because believe it or not every emotion that a human being can experience every single emotion that is an elevated emotion passion Elation Joy arousal libido all the heck yeah I won the lottery emotions if you actually looked at that molecule it has oxygen as a component of its structure if you pull oxygen out of that molecular structure you can't have that emotion this is why no human being has ever woken up laughing but you can't wake up angry why can you wake up angry but not wake up laughing you don't have the oxidative state to experience laughter but anger Vengeance despair jealousy depression require zero oxygen right if you want to do a fun little experiment tonight wait till your spouse who's in a deep sleep and give them a good deep pinch watch him wake up really angry well hey

46
00:36:31,619 --> 00:37:59,279
Gary was right I was just checking it out you know that's not on me you didn't wake up laughing see he was right really smart human biologist so so if we want to reach elevated emotional tears we need to have the oxidative state to reach elevated emotional tears so that's what we're gonna do the fourth thing that it does is it releases sirtuins how many of you have ever heard of a sirtuin you know what a certain is it's a survival Gene it happens when we slip under the ice it happens when we get too close to a fire it happens when a lion gets too close to us and threatens us they are called sirtuins these scour the body of free radical oxidation they increase the rate of protein synthesis and you can access them for free every single day you guys want to do it

47
00:37:15,359 --> 00:38:38,200
all right it's going to get a little weird in here all right so you're just going to sit you can put first we'll just put our hands comfortably on our laps Ben what I want you to do men is I want you to make a fist and when I tell you we're going to tap up in our chest like this you are not trying to knock your boob over your shoulder right it's like somehow it becomes like a mankind it's like hit himself in the face you're gonna attack you're gonna take your fists and you're going to tap up on your breasts like this and we're going to do it four times wait wait till I start it we're all going to do it together we're going to take a deep breath in like this and when we breathe out we're going to say the word ha four times and we're just going to tap our chest like this

48
00:37:57,720 --> 00:39:29,642
women you're going to Cross Your Hands raise them up and you're going to tap your fists on your shoulder okay so and we're going to take a deep breath in and on the way out you're going to say four times I know this sounds crazy wait till we do three of these breaths and wait till you see how you feel you're gonna release their twins we're gonna raise our emotional state we're going to elevate our mood we're going to flood the brain with oxygen you guys ready to go all right I want an obnoxious breath in we're going to do three rounds of this ready a deep breath in yeah now aside from offending your neighbors and everybody else in the hotel if you actually did that on your balcony every morning you would wake up like a Spartan warrior right my poor wife has to listen to it every

49
00:38:57,480 --> 00:40:24,699
day and then I'm so chit chatty when I'm done she likes to sleep in I come in I want to tell her all about my day and get stuff off my chest I used to have a whole Instagram special it was called good morning babe and right after I would do breath work in Haka breathing I would go in and wake her up and go and dance on the bed she one time on Instagram in front of half a million people she threatened to stab me in the neck you did still I still have the video so um so in any case so we're gonna get oxygen into our bodies um I'm going to talk about supplements in a second because you know I don't want anybody to just start taking supplements for the sake of supplementing I want you to do the gene test we have a booth outside by the way the 10x Health Booth I want you to go to

50
00:39:43,140 --> 00:41:34,321
that booth and talk to those guys about how to get that Gene test for you and your family once and then never guess on what you need to supplement with um and now I want to talk about the brain because Joe dispenza an MIT you guys like Joe dispenza all right oh I man I really love you guys we're we're working on filming a documentary uh called the frequency of Truth and part of the um part of the documentary is about the power of the human brain which we are only now beginning to understand God is so much more powerful than modern medicine that it's unbelievable the capability that this has to influence the environment around it to heal the environment around it to heal itself is absolutely uncanny in Scandinavia they just did a clinical trial a clinical study on terminally ill

51
00:40:38,460 --> 00:42:15,659
cancer patients and by the way any of the studies that I ever talk about from the stage if you'd like to see those they're on my link Tree on Instagram um or I'm happy to send you these articles I am a science nerd so if you ever would like to know what study I'm referring to I'm happy to send that study to you but what they did was they took two groups of people both of these people were diagnosed with the same terminal illness only they took one into one room and one into another and with one placebo group they told them the truth about their illness that it was terminal the percentage chance of five-year survival and that modern medicine had exhausted everything that they had and there was essentially nothing they could do other than to extend them palliative care

52
00:41:26,760 --> 00:43:26,641
hospice palliative care they took an identical group of people into another room and they said you have this type of cancer but luckily for you you qualify for a clinical trial and then during the in this trial we've had a 100 percent cure rate 100 of the patients that have qualified for this trial have gone into remission and you're so lucky you have the tissue type that matches this trial and so there's virtually a hundred percent chance that you're going to go into remission what they measured was the shift in frequency the shift in that person's emotional state and what we realize now is that there's an area in the brain called the amygdala when you feel emotion any mood any emotional state that you can feel you are experiencing that emotion in an area of the brain called the amygdala

53
00:42:26,940 --> 00:44:17,498
okay and what's special about this area if you're happy if you're elated if you're upset if you're angry you're feeling that in that area of the brain called the amygdala what's interesting about the amygdala is that it is the only Gateway to the hippocampus to the memory there is only one hallway that you can go down to reach your memory and that is through the amygdala that which means your emotional state determines what Memories you retrieve well your memory links to the prefrontal cortex your conscience and your conscience is your future and so what this means is that your current emotional state determines your future if you do not learn to master your emotional state you will never take control of your future so whoa so my whole reason for existing in life

54
00:43:24,300 --> 00:45:02,519
is because I want to elevate the emotional state of humanity I want to elevate the mood of humanity by putting the right raw materials into your body so you can manufacture the neurotransmitters to stay in an elevated state so you retrieve healthy memories you think healthy thoughts and you project a very healthy future right and so imagine the emotional state of someone who is just told they turn had a terminal illness versus the emotional state of somebody who was actually told there's virtually 100 chance they're going to live just compare those two emotional states and imagine what Memories they started to access and then imagine what their conscience began to think of and imagine what happened to their future 47 of terminally ill patients went into spontaneous remission

55
00:44:13,079 --> 00:45:44,880
it's almost half of the patients in that study right this is the power of frequency this is the power of the human body this is the power of the mind we can actually use this to our advantage to influence the world in a positive way around us last year you might have heard me talk about the Spain scale of emotion the scale of positive and negative emotion right where they took participants they put them in a room it's called a Faraday's cage it's devoid of frequency they started to measure frequency leaving a human being's body and what they realized was that the most powerful frequency to leave a human's being's body somebody yell it out authenticity if you want to influence the world around you everything from your children to the people that you interact with to

56
00:44:59,400 --> 00:46:38,220
a client you're trying to gain a listing from from a team you're trying to motivate from a spouse you're trying to convince from a child you're trying to discipline if you can Master the frequency if you can emanate the frequency of authenticity you can actually change their emotional state this is a fact mile away you know we say that women are more intuitive have you heard that okay that's actually not true women are more sensitive to frequency we call it intuition is a sensitivity to frequency I can't even tell you how many times my wife has said nope not that guy something's a little magic can't put a finger on it but I don't like him I'm like but babe look at his shoes and his side he's got a nice suit drove a Ferrari how bad could he be six months later I'm

57
00:45:49,020 --> 00:47:19,740
taking the knife out of my back right how many of you guys can identify with that right so you are sensitive to this frequency of authenticity it's the most powerful frequency to leave a human being's body there's a law in physics called constructive interference look it up if you'd like it says if two frequencies of equal wavelength meet the size of the frequency doubles this proves the universal law of attraction right it's it's the universal law of attraction is actually a law in physics so but the point is most of us don't understand how to master this in our lives so I'm actually going to teach you a technique to master our emotion to pull from the right memory to project the proper Consciousness to change our future and it is powerful enough that when you use it in business and in life

58
00:46:34,140 --> 00:48:34,620
and in your career and in your relationships you will see the entire trajectory of these change it is so powerful that it will influence the decision-making capacity of another individual because we know now that emotion is what triggers our memory and memory triggers our conscience and our conscience is our future we also know what percentage by the way I'll just ask you what percentage of decision making is emotional by the way let's just published in the Journal of neuropsychology what percentage of decision making is emotional 95 100 not quite 100 maybe maybe with my wife it's a hundred but um 75 to 78 percent of decision making is emotional so if what should be the most important thing that you do before you get on a phone call to or a team meeting or a zoom to

59
00:47:34,140 --> 00:48:55,019
motivate your team you should first of all you should master your own emotion I'm gonna tell you how you do that you should try to impact the emotional state of the people that you're that you're talking to in fact if I could teach you how to influence the emotional state of a client then when you get went to get a listing if you actually trigger the right emotion in that client that makes them recall the proper memory they will decide to give you that listing so how many of you would like to do that all right so let's talk about how we tap into this right and and this is um you know I'm far along right now but this is what's about to be um published in our in our documentary so first of all these areas of the brain need certain amino acids they need certain vitamins they

60
00:48:14,819 --> 00:49:42,420
need certain nutrients because this entire Cascade happens by neurotransmitters so the second way that you can tap into it is to get yourself in a state of authenticity authenticity only occurs when two things are present number one when your words are truthful and number two when you believe what you're saying if either one of those is not present you cannot actually emanate the frequency of authenticity and by the way this is part of the clinical study the Spain scale of emotion I'm happy to send that to you so this is what some women pick up on because somebody's words are not truthful or they don't believe what they're saying and we don't pick up on that but very often women will pick up on that and say there's just something that's not adding up here because that

61
00:48:58,560 --> 00:50:36,299
person is not emanating the frequency of authenticity so if you want to shift into an authentic State I want you to do this before your next team meeting I want you to do this before your next client meeting I want you to do this for for your next big event so that you can actually have influence over that person in a positive way okay ready so first it starts with intention setting and second it moves to something called visualization but only about five percent of the population really understands the power of visualization when I work with athletes and and and top fighters in the UFC and running backs in the NFL part of what I do is I teach them how to visualize outcomes never ever ever visualize the journey if you visualize the journey you will set yourself up for failure if you

62
00:49:47,099 --> 00:51:21,941
visualize the destination you will set yourself up for success this is why I love being a man of Faith because it's not only delayed gratification but I already know where I'm going right so so I know what the destination is so all the stuff in the middle doesn't bother me so much but so here's how we do it how do we set our intentions so for example before I got on this stage today I sat quietly in a chair back there close my eyes I took three deep breaths like this and I thought about what was my intention of getting on this stage today my intention was to add value to your life right so that's the only reason why I'm here right now for the next 60 to 90 minutes of my life I said I'm going to give everything that I can so I can provide value to this audience and then I created a picture

63
00:50:40,260 --> 00:52:16,020
of every person in this room hearing my words believing those words agreeing to put those words into action of thanking me for speaking and I actually lived that moment right and then when I got up here I didn't have any fear and my words were truthful and I believed what I was saying so I was able to deliver an authentic message and we can use the same thing in business we can use the same thing when we're getting on a call to motivate our team so the first thing we do is we take three put your hands just like this Everybody Just Close Your Eyes and we're going to take three deep breaths through our nose and we're going to let it out through our mouth ready second one third one now in this state this is where we set Our intention what is my intention of this team

64
00:51:41,760 --> 00:53:19,918
meeting do I intend to motivate my team I tend to inspire my team what message do I want them to receive only use one word to describe your intention and once you know what your intention is for this meeting right I want to gain this listing I want this person to give me the trust and confidence to sign over their home to me and my team I want to motivate my team I want to take the people that are struggling I want to bring them back into the herd so you set the intention the second thing you do is you visualize the outcome and this is where visualization goes wrong I want you to create a picture of the end destination the end of that meeting everybody thanking you for being inspiring today thanking you for the message that you gave them I want you to see that client

65
00:52:30,059 --> 00:54:13,079
shaking your hand congratulating you on gaining that listing because they have the trust and the confidence in you and then I want you to open your eyes and now that you've set your intention and you visualize that you know what you've done you've set your emotional state you're now in an authentic State guess what happens in your hippocampus your hippocampus records everything in a picture memory is stored in pictures when you hear a song that reminds you of a loved one it's not the song that's in your memory it's the image that's in your memory that song triggered an emotion and that emotion linked to your memory and then you formed a picture of that last time that you were around that that loved one right that's why you can be driving down the road you can hear a

66
00:53:22,319 --> 00:54:42,780
country music song and all of a sudden tears come to your eyes because it reminds you of your mother or your father or a loved one that's left your life right that is an emotion triggering a picture so if you actually change your emotional state through breath work set your intention which sets your emotion form a picture now what happens to your conscience and your future your brain starts to live that and you will emanate the frequency of authenticity authenticity will hit that person's body authenticity will match the frequency in their body it will raise their elevated emotional state and they will have no idea why they trust you so much why they are so confident in you but they will give you that listing your team will be inspired you will find that your

67
00:54:01,740 --> 00:55:40,681
objection hits with more meaning and so that's how we start to set ourselves up for these kinds of events try it it takes about 60 seconds to shift into that state wait till you see the hormetic research that is coming out on this on the capacity for human beings to influence the world around them you know in the animal world this is how this is how um animals are eliminated and killed and how they seek safety and stay together if you want if you look at how Dolphins use use sonar if a fish separates from the school they can send sonar into a school of fish and find the one fish out of 15 000 fish that is not emanating the right frequency and they can go right into that school of fish and hit that fish when a lion is hunting a herd they look for the weakest animal

68
00:54:51,420 --> 00:56:18,300
and they separate that weakest animal and human beings we can have the same kind of influence on one another by emanating the frequency of authenticity did you guys find that helpful all right all right you know they don't talk about science don't talk about politics don't talk about the vaccine I think we covered it all right any other sensitive subjects we need to go over um so everybody asked me what my morning routine is I'm going to run through my morning routine I'm going to teach you how to wake up like a Spartan warrior whoa and I'm going to tell you three things you need to take out of your diet three things you need to put into your day so you can start to become a superhuman these are all for free and then I'm going to open it up for questions and testimonials there's a

69
00:55:35,220 --> 00:57:02,399
microphone right there and I think I think there's a microphone over here yeah there's a microphone right here um if you have questions and because if you have a question and I and I take that answer probably people in the audience have the same answer my morning routine is very very simple I wake up in the morning I find Sunlight I go out in a pair of shorts I sit in sunlight I do eight minutes of breath work every single day my wife will tell you I never ever ever ever Miss I will miss a commercial flight not to miss breath work I didn't miss it this morning I don't miss it when I travel you can actually set your circadian rhythm by this so when you change time zones if you breathe at the same time every morning your body knows this is the time to wake up I clear

70
00:56:18,540 --> 00:57:50,561
catecholamines from my brain I make my body inhospitable to disease to pathology I raise my mood I raise my emotional state and I get it all from God and get it all for free all right so first thing in the morning I get natural sunlight and I do an eight minute breath work routine and it looks just like the breath work that you guys just did sometimes I do the hakka breathing unless somebody is sleeping then I don't like then I don't like to wake them up but I do three rounds of 30 breasts deep breaths I do 30 of those breaths I hold my breath as long as I can I take a deep breath in I do 30 more of those breaths I hold my breath as long as I can I take a deep breath in I do 30 breaths hold take a deep breath in and I'm done it takes about eight minutes to do that

71
00:57:08,880 --> 00:58:44,101
breath work takes a lot longer now I I can actually hold my breath for four minutes in between rounds of breath when I started I could only hold my breath for 30 seconds now I can do 30 breaths and I can sit for four minutes so that's what takes the longest amount of time so I do breath work then I go out and I get it I'll get first light I do my breath work I get 10 ounces of water by the way first thing I want you to get out of your out of your diet um I'm kind of jumping ahead here is um tap water um never ever ever again drink water out of the tap right um uh and the reason for this is look if you don't know if if having a water filtration system is not in the budget get a get a Brita water filter that at a minimum gets chlorine and fluoride out of your water if you have seen the

72
00:57:56,460 --> 00:59:21,599
clinical trials the clinical studies in the last 15 months coming out on fluoride they are absolutely devastating they're devastating Harvard University just launched a study through the Freedom of Information Act we sued the CDC and the FDA and we actually got the research that they kept suppressed on on water if you don't believe me you can go to the National Institute of Health look up the study yourself there is zero levels of safe fluoride in human beings it's a neurotoxin they find that the higher the fluoride concentration in the water the lower the IQ in every state where they study this so stop drinking tap water if you need to just go buy a six or ten dollar Brita water filter if you want to know the filtration system that I use there's a link on my Instagram I don't have any

73
00:58:39,119 --> 01:00:05,639
affiliation with this company but I put everything that I use in my own um life there so I want you to get tap water um what's that oh a Wells or Wells are fine yeah so well and septic is fine it's the tap water that's bad it's the concentration of fluoride I try to ground myself every day if I can't ground myself I lay on a pmf mat if you if you don't want to spend the money on a pulse electromagnetic field mat take your shoes off and touch the Earth for 10 minutes three times a week I know this sounds simple you know I talk about breath work and sunlight and cold showers and things it seems so simple that people don't want to do it I promise it can change the trajectory of your life I do a cold plunge if you don't have a cold plunge turn the water as cold as you can make it step into it

74
00:59:22,260 --> 01:00:47,440
for a minute and just deal with it stop pursuing Comfort by yeah for stop aggressively aging by pursuing comfort okay so that is my morning routine um I would really like to open up the uh the room for to to questions any ailment that you or a loved one suffers from and maybe if you could come up to the microphone if you're comfortable enough to ask the question in front of this group I'd really love to answer it for you um because this is this is where the real value comes into play oh and then I take my supplements too oh what's the two other things that I want you to get out of your diet um so first is I want you to stop drinking tap water the second is I want you to get rid of seed oils seed oils I got censored all over Instagram my entire account deleted by

75
01:00:06,960 --> 01:01:39,061
the fact Checkers for it I never said seed oils are bad I said industrial processed seed oils are bad so let's just cover this for 10 seconds you take a canola oil plant you press it it comes out like gum so how do you de-gum it they use hexane a neurotoxin the D gum it then they take de-gumed neurotoxic oil and they heat it to 405 degrees that makes it rancid now it smells so bad they can't bottle it so they deodorize it with with sodium chloride which is a known carcinogen now it's deodorized but it's cloudy so they make it clear by bleaching it with chlorine so they take a neurotoxin they add a carcinogen and then they bleach it with chlorine and then they put it on the shelf and they serve it to you you need four oils in your life you need a coconut oil for cooking a

76
01:00:52,380 --> 01:02:26,640
ghee butter a grass-fed butter or tallow you need an olive oil and an avocado oil at room temperature that's it that's all you need right so four to cook and two to use for salads and and dressings and everything else if it's a palm oil a sunflower oil safflower oil Guys these are rancid toxic inflammatory um neuroinhibitory chemicals that we're putting into our body so I want you to um to get those out of your body as well yes sir my dad has Ankylosing Spondylitis where the spine is fusing itself together what would you say for something like that yeah so Ankylosing Spondylitis is also known as candle wax spine right so it's actually where if you actually look at the spine on an X-ray it'll look like candle wax it'll look like those are dripping this is actually not an issue with the bone it's

77
01:01:40,140 --> 01:03:10,920
an issue right above the Disco space with something called the periosteum and if you actually Google amniotic stem cell and ankylosing spondylolisthesis I know that's a big word but if you but I want you to put the word amniotic stem cell in front of it you're going to see some of the most astounding clinical trials where they're actually able to repair the periosteal layer of the bone and stop this waxy dripping stop the spine from actually starting to disintegrate in on itself we always used to think that once these pathologies had started that they were irreversible we know now that that is absolutely not true right we don't just have to manage disease we can stop it and reverse it so if you like to see me after the breakout I'll give you some links to some of the research and some

78
01:02:25,440 --> 01:04:01,319
of the places in California that are actually treating that yeah naturally whoa yes ma'am so two questions last year we were here and my husband stood up and he has Parkinson's disease and I don't know if you're able to answer that question last year I don't recall but yes the second part of it is I had you talked about genetic diseases things like that but I had a son who passed away of adrenal leukodystrophy which is an x-linked genetic disease that is a true genetic disease and then I have a son who's now 27 who tests positive for that but hasn't shown any symptoms and I guess I'm just wondering what what can be done like if it's x-linked versus genetic like you talked about and then what is possible for people yeah so so let me answer the first one real quick

79
01:03:13,859 --> 01:04:39,480
and then I'll answer the second one so the first one with Parkinson's so Parkinson's is a neuroinflammatory disorder right I mean at the end of the day this is inflammation in the nerves so if we can reduce the inflammatory Cascade right and we can heal the violin in the nerve um then we can stop or even reverse the the the symptoms of Parkinson's we all also know now that Parkinson's disease is linked to the gut bacteria there are actually gases that are emitted from gut bacteria when we are absent certain Flora we are absent certain um we're absent certain gut Flora we're absent certain necessary gases in our gut and and these actually go up to the brain and they cause neural inflammation you would not believe how much of our health and wellness is actually related to the health of our

80
01:03:56,220 --> 01:05:14,099
gut when we destroy our gut with antibiotics and we destroy our gut with artificial sweeteners which by the way you know Aspartame is about to be named by the World Health Organization as a known carcinogen it's about to be outlawed in all European countries it will stay in the United States for 10 years right because we're the only governmental agency in the world that uses something called single dose toxicity to decide whether or not we can poison our population right we don't use cumulative dose toxicity we use single dose toxicity so Parkinson's I'd love to give you some of the research on on on Parkinson there's something called vinyere Resveratrol there's another product called stem regen which is very has shows extreme promise in treating Parkinson's disorder but there's also a

product called TSO 1000 which repopulates the gut specifically with the Flora that combats the neuroinflammatory condition in Parkinson so we did those two tests last year I mean not two we each did okay test and you said it's one time does that mean that that results will never change the results will never change the genes you're born with are the genes you die with that's why that's why that test is so important because now you're supplementing for deficiency remember that DNA exists in the exact same form in every single cell in the human body if it's broken in one cell it's broken in every cell so there's nothing more impactful for human beings than changing our DNA so supplying our DNA with the raw material it needs to do its job right I mean DNA only has two roles

82
01:05:15,660 --> 01:06:46,018
replication and transcription create a perfect copy of itself and give commands to the cell like a CEO so when the DNA is not giving the right command the cell dysfunctions when the DNA doesn't replicate person perfectly this is where you get dysfunction all cancer all cancer is DNA replication run amok if you didn't have DNA replication was not impaired you could not have cancer right and this is the same issue with the vaccine right we took an a message from the nucleus to the cell called the messenger RNA and we made a permanent copy of it and we injected this into human beings and now that permanent copy never starts giving it stops giving the command to the cell when the DNA gives a command it eviscerates in two hours when a synthetic messenger RNA enters

83
01:06:00,839 --> 01:07:31,261
the human body it never turns off the signal the cell never stops producing the nuclear capsid protein right so we're only now beginning to know the consequences of that but um I'd love to talk to you more about the second part I don't know yeah I'd love to talk to you more about the uh the Parkinson's offline so we can just get get to a few more questions maybe about my son's disease too no question yeah yes ma'am uh that was serious mine is kind of vague um you're like how do I lose belly fat in here I'm curious about rosacea yeah I was diagnosed with that and they told me there's no cure uh it's an autoimmune disease I call pull yes so autoimmune disease as a general category is actually not autoimmune disease it's autoimmune weakness okay all autoimmune disease is not it's a progressive

84
01:06:46,500 --> 01:08:04,379
dysfunction of the immune system because it's too weak right it's a weakening of the immune system and so autoimmune conditions generally are where the immune system is dysfunctional right it doesn't know the difference between friendly tissue and foreign tissue but what makes it incapable of recognizing friendly or foreign tissue whether it's rheumatoid or chagrins or any number of autoimmune conditions is because the immune system is so weak so we have a theory in modern medicine that we should weaken the immune system to keep it from attacking itself we should actually strengthen the immune system so it can properly tell the difference between healthy tissue and foreign tissue we know now for example Crohn's disease which we call an autoimmune disease is not the immune system dysfunctioning

85
01:07:25,200 --> 01:08:46,500
it's the immune system properly doing its job attacking bacteria in the luminal wall of the intestine but we try to shut the immune system off instead of getting the bacteria out of the wall okay so we're Sunshine more Sunshine more dirt on the feet no so so so rosacea yeah most Sun time more dirt on the feet breath work Sunshine dirt on the feet and cold showers but um rosacea is a secondary um route of waste elimination for the liver so you want to heal the liver with glutathione thank you so much yeah thanks oh yeah yes sir all right Gary uh dude I I like are you guys liking this I I yeah all right because I know this okay I got about two you know a few more minutes and I really want to add some value yes sir pulmonary emboli um so pulmonary embolism as depends on

86
01:08:06,000 --> 01:09:28,260
what's causing the pulmonary embolism right so I mean deep vein thrombosis are a big cause of pulmonary embolism I actually um sage and I just actually flew to uh Dubai a few months ago when we got back one of the passengers um that we flew with actually dropped dead in the in the uh in the baggage claim area from a pulmonary embolism from from what's called a deep vein thrombosis I did 30 minutes of CPR on them while the U.S customs just stood around and just watched me no one even knew what an AED was for the wall but so we when you travel you'll get wear compression gear especially if you're on a flight over five hours but one of the best ways to avoid defeating thrombosis and Pulmonary embolisms is to make sure that your blood stays at the right viscosity this is why I think every

87
01:08:47,100 --> 01:10:16,261
single person needs to know more about your own biome than you do about your business like when I go up to you and you can tell me your income statement your balance sheet and your p l but you can't tell me your blood sugar your hormone levels or your nutrient deficiencies that tells me where you're oriented right this is our Temple you guys should get information on your temple and you should feed it with things that serve your temple don't steal from it right because we often wonder why we're in this condition and then you ask them well what what is your sugar been like what have your hormones been like what has what nutrients are your body missing they have no idea they find out when disease or pathology or embolism strike so the best way to avoid dvts and and

88
01:09:31,440 --> 01:11:02,639
um and Pulmonary embolisms and embolisms of all kinds is to keep your hematocrit level your blood viscosity at you know the right at the right viscosity and you can check that on on a blood test okay right because yeah right now it's been blood thinners because there's no evidence of any deep into thrombosis or anything else so a lifetime of blood thinners as a defense mechanism no interest in staying on those um so there's something called Vineyard veritrol and they're they're um uh or other things you can do like regular blood donations to keep your blood thin and let's talk about it at the um let's talk about it at the break because I've got to close things off right here but guys I appreciate you so much thank you so much for listening today I hope you feel like you've got

89
01:10:17,219 --> 01:10:32,641
some value out of today I love you guys thank you thank you thank you come on
